Well done!

White background is good on some pages like decor, but it's ruining the view in case you have both white and transparent background. 
Pictures are good for buttons on the main page. But there is no consistency in using swimmers picture on other pages to navigate to the next one. It would be better to use (for example) arrow -> or vice versa navigate user to the main page by home button.
