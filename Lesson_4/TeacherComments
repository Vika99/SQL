Well done!

b)
You can insert multiple rows by having it divided by comma, like this:
INSERT INTO Production.UnitMeasure
VALUES 
('TT1', 'Test1', '2020-09-09'),
('TT2','Test2',GETDATE())

Also, I think you missed part of the task with adding one more row.
INSERT INTO Production.UnitMeasureTest
SELECT *
FROM Production.UnitMeasure
WHERE UnitMeasureCode='CAN'

e) -1
The task was to use window functions, like
SELECT SalesOrderID,			
		MIN (LineTotal) OVER (PARTITION BY SalesOrderID) AS min,
		MAX (LineTotal) OVER (PARTITION BY SalesOrderID) AS max,
		AVG (LineTotal) OVER (PARTITION BY SalesOrderID) AS avg
FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail
WHERE SalesOrderID IN (43659,43664)

g)
The task was not to find the solution, but to create yours.
