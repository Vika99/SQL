Well done!


A -1
If you unite all rows from tables that you marked, it will be a correct answer. But the thing is that we don't have one column for car, we have 5.

B -1
Age is a calculated field and we don't store calculated fields in the database. Also your solution will lead to joining on the ФИО, which is very bad.

C -1
The fact that we have values divided by comma already means that it's not even a 1nf.

D
There are two separate tables in your solution. How will you connect them?

E -1
In the 3nf we need to have table to store relations between dimensions (fact tables). You showed only dimensions, but from your model we can't see the intersection between two datasets (for example, who owns each car).

F -1
Total_inc_vat is a calculated field and we don't store calculated fields in the database.
